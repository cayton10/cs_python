# Magic 8 Ball

You can find the tutorial to this project [here](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-cs-101/modules/cspath-python-control-flow/projects/python-magic-8-ball)

## Goal
The goal of this simple project is to build a rng to yield an answer to a question.

## Changes
I made changes to the tutorial by incorporating some dynamism to take a user's input for name and question. The original tutorial had the name and question hard coded into the program. Can learn more about python's [input() function here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/taking-input-in-python/)

## Stretch
The stretch goal asked tutorial followers to check for a name and question before outputting the answer. I've done that along with adding dynamic inputs. Can probably do more with checking valid strings, etc, but this is a really simple tutorial project and I need to move on to data structures.


# Sal's Shipping

You can find the tutorial to the Sal's Shipping project [here](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-cs-101/modules/cspath-python-control-flow/projects/python-sals-shipping)

## Goal
The goal of this simple project is to build a shipping calculator based on shipping weight and three different shipping methods
Each shipping method has its' own set of charges associated with type

## Stretch
Incorporated user input again. The project calls for simple input of package weight, but I included a method for users to enter their package weight as well as their desired shipping method. Probably wouldn't hurt to display the rates for each shipping method prior to user selection
